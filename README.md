# Homework Tracker
## Brief Description of the Proposed Research Project:
### Minimum Viable Product:
* Web-based app
* The user adds tasks and due dates for each class or tag. 
*  Course information and course tasks may be imported through a blackboard account or scraped from Kent website, or manually inserted by the user.
* Each task may be associated with a tag which can either be a class or a custom tag (work, personal, student club, etc.) 
* DB Stores: Acct. info, Tasks, Tags, Task due dates, Task start dates, Task planned working days, Task priority
* Users will be able to visualize all their upcoming tasks with each due date as well as a personally made priority listing. Tasks can be listed via a calendar, listed by each tag, or by user assigned priority.
* User marks on the app when each task is completed.
###  Additional Expansions:
* Class Schedule – Room and Time
 
## Justification/Rationale for the Project:
Blackboard does much of this. However, it doesn’t necessarily do it well. I basically do what this app does by hand every semester. It would be nice for it to be more automated.
Three features of this app which I would have really enjoyed using in my college years:
* All In One:
  * Ability to have all school tasks in one place. Blackboard has most of the tasks in one place; however, there is often that one professor who doesn’t upload due dates to blackboard and so you need to keep track of it another way. This app has everything in one spot.
* Planned Working Days:
  *  The app allows users to plan when they will work on a certain task. This helps with scheduling and planning out the semesters course load.
* Priorities:
  *  And then also, I like assigning priorities to my tasks for the day. That way I’m sure to get the important ones done in time.
